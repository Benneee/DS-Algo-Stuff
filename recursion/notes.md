## **Recursion**

#### Taking a problem and chopping it up in smaller pieces until you hit a basecase

#### Recursion is a function that calls itself. Recursion can be a cleaner alternative to iterations.

#### It will be seen more with complex data structures

### Examples of common methods that use recursion

- JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
- Object traversal methods/algos

## **Call Stack**

#### The built-in data structure that manages what happens when functions are invoked.

#### When working with recursion, we will be using the call stack a lot, we keep pushing new functions onto the the call stack when we write recursive functions

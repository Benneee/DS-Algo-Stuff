function charCount(str) {
  // make an object to return at the end
  // loop over the string, for each character
  // - If the char is a number or letter AND is a key in the previously created object, add one to count
  // - If the char is a number or letter AND not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
  // - If the char is something else, i.e space, period, e.t.c, do not do anything
  // return object at the end
